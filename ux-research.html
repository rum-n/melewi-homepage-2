That way, you'll have evidence-based facts to back up your design decision. For example, you found out that 75% of your users are confused by the layout of your contact form, so you redesign the form to be more intuitive."

It's possible to still design a good product, without conducting a proper UX Research, just by taking general assumptions about what your users would expect to see from your product. Still, if time and budget allows it, it's a safer bet to base your design decisions on solid data, instead of presumptions."

Depending on the type of information we're after we'll choose the type research we need to conduct - qualitative or quantitative. A qualitative user research means we'll perform individual interviews with a select number of people, where we ask them specific questions and record their opinions and feelings. On the other hand, quantitative user research means we'll create surveys and questionnaires, which users can fill out. We'll then gather the results and crunch the numbers to produce actionable insights."

                    <h3 class="collapsible-header">What is UX Research?</h3>
                    <div class="collapsible-body"><span>A UX Research is an exploration into a certain product's users and the way they interact with it. It can be an existing product that has been around for a while and has collected enough data that can be analyzed (e.g. number of page views, time spent per page etc.) or it can be a prototype of a new product tested specifically with a select group of people.</span></div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3 class="collapsible-header">Why is UX Research necessary?</h3>
                    <div class="collapsible-body"><span>Conducting a UX Research is beneficial to understand exactly how your target audience interacts with your product. That way, you'll have evidence-based facts to back up your design decision. For example, you found out that 75% of your users are confused by the layout of your contact form, so you redesign the form to be more intuitive.</span></div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3 class="collapsible-header">Can I have good design without UX Research?</h3>
                    <div class="collapsible-body"><span>Yes. It's possible to still design a good product, without conducting a proper UX Research, just by taking general assumptions about what your users would expect to see from your product. Still, if time and budget allows it, it's a safer bet to base your design decisions on solid data, instead of presumptions.</span></div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3 class="collapsible-header">How do you conduct UX Research?</h3>
                    <div class="collapsible-body"><span>The first step to conducting a UX Research is to determine what we need to collect data on. Depending on the type of information we're after we'll choose the type research we need to conduct - qualitative or quantitative.<br> A qualitative user research means we'll perform individual interviews with a select number of people, where we ask them specific questions and record their opinions and feelings. <br>On the other hand, quantitative user research means we'll create surveys and questionnaires, which users can fill out. We'll then gather the results and crunch the numbers to produce actionable insights.</span></div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3 class="collapsible-header">Can UX Research be done remotely?</h3>
                    <div class="collapsible-body"><span>Yes. As a remote first company, we've conducted UX Research entirely remotely. The most important thing is to determine who your user will be. Having a user persona will help us create a list of candidates we can then interview remotely, using tools for online communication and screen recording.</span></div>
